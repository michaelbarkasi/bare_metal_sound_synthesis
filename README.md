# bare_metal_sound_synthesis
two-timer PWM for snythesizing sound with pitch, volume, and duty cycle control on SAMD51 and ESP32

This is code I created in 2021 for use in motion sonification experiments. 
I needed light weight sound synthesis on small embedded microprocessors that would respond with only a few microseconds of latency and leave the vast majority of the processor time available for motion processing.
